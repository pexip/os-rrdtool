=head1 NAME

rrdlist - List directories and rrd databases.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<rrdtool> B<list>
S<[B<--daemon>|B<-d> I<address>]>
I<path>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<list> function connects to L<rrdcached>, the RRD caching daemon,
and issues a "list" command for the given path. This provides an 'ls-like'
interface for traversing and listing the rrd database tree.

=item B<--daemon>|B<-d> I<address>

Address of the L<rrdcached> daemon. If not specified, the
RRDCACHED_ADDRESS environment variable must be set (see below).  For a
list of accepted formats, see the B<-l> option in the L<rrdcached>
manual.

C<rrdtoolE<nbsp>list>:

line argument takes precedence.
